# LLM / AI-agent accessibility - demo-mechanik

## Problem summary
Audit and fix how accessible this site is to AI crawlers and browser-using agents. This is not SEO ranking (separate concern, seo-agent's job) - it is whether AI crawlers, chat assistants, and browser-using agents can actually reach, parse, and act on the content at all. Covers: AI crawler / robots.txt policy for named bots (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, CCBot, ChatGPT-User, etc., with the training-vs-retrieval distinction), llms.txt correctness, content readability without JS execution (this app already has Angular SSR via @angular/ssr and src/server.ts, so this should mostly be a verification item, not a build from scratch), semantic HTML, structured data / entity clarity, API/MCP discoverability (not applicable - no public API), browser-agent usability (labeled interactive elements, no unnecessary CAPTCHA, working service-cost-calculator and booking flow, client-zone repair history), citation/attribution readiness.

Acceptance criteria: agent produces a prioritized findings report; every actionable finding is implemented (user has approved implementing everything the agent proposes).

## Task shape and scale
One task (LLM-accessibility audit + fix) applied identically across 4 independent portfolio demo repos (demo-fryzjer, demo-hydraulik, demo-mechanik, demo-restauracja - separate GitHub repos, separate git histories). Each repo is audited and fixed independently by its own llm-accessibility-agent instance running in parallel. Steps 6-10 (review, verify, docs) run per repo, in parallel where independent.

## Deviation from default workflow
- No CLAUDE.md exists in this repo (deliberately removed - see commit "chore: remove CLAUDE.md"). README.md is used as the per-project context source instead.
- No feature-flag system detected - feature-flag question is not raised.
- No CHANGELOG.md / real version field existed before this change (package.json had a placeholder "0.0.0"). Per explicit user decision, this task introduces CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog format) and bumps the version to 0.1.0 as part of Step 10.

## Affected layers
Frontend only - static assets (robots.txt, llms.txt), index.html, semantic HTML/ARIA in src/, structured data (JSON-LD), SSR verification (server.ts, app.config.server.ts).

## Implementation sequence
1. llm-accessibility-agent audits: robots.txt, llms.txt, verify SSR actually renders full content server-side (no client-only gaps), semantic HTML, structured data, browser-agent usability (service cost calculator, multi-step booking, client repair-history zone), forms.
2. Agent reports findings with severity, then implements all actionable findings directly.
3. Code review (Step 6) on the changed files.
4. Build and verify (Step 7) - confirm SSR output includes the fixed content (curl the SSR-rendered HTML directly, not just the browser DOM).
5. Docs (Step 10): update README.md if user-facing setup changed; add CHANGELOG.md and bump package.json version 0.0.0 -> 0.1.0.

## Edge cases to address
- Existing robots.txt/llms.txt already present - agent must review and refine, not blindly overwrite.
- SSR output must be checked directly (curl/view-source), not assumed correct just because SSR is configured.
- PWA service worker must not intercept or block crawler/agent requests to content.
- Booking/calculator flow must remain usable by browser-agents (labeled inputs, no CAPTCHA blocking legitimate flows).

## Agent delegation plan
- llm-accessibility-agent: owns the entire repo (public/, index.html, src/ where relevant to rendering/semantic HTML/structured data, robots.txt, llms.txt, SSR config). Runs in parallel with three other llm-accessibility-agent instances covering demo-fryzjer, demo-hydraulik, demo-restauracja - disjoint file sets (separate git repos), no conflict possible.
- Branching/PR: feature branch feat/llm-accessibility (already created), commit directly on this branch, push and open a PR only after explicit user approval.

## Feature-flag decision
Not applicable - no feature-flag system detected in this repo.
